👾 React Native Template 
Build Status Documentation Maintenance License: MIT

Clean and minimalist React Native template for a quick start with TypeScript.

⭐ Features
Elegant usage directly within the React Native CLI
Consistent with the default React Native template
Minimal additional dependencies
▶️ Usage
npx react-native init SomeApp --template https://github.com/abduliOS/RCTemplate.git

See the below table to find out which version of the template to use.

⚠️ React Native CLI
This template only works with the new CLI. Make sure you have uninstalled the legacy react-native-cli first (npm uninstall -g react-native-cli) for the below command to work. If you wish to not use npx, you can also install the new CLI globally (npm i -g @react-native-community/cli or yarn global add @react-native-community/cli).

If you tried the above and still get the react-native-template-react- native-template-typescript: Not found error, please try adding the --ignore-existing flag to force npx to ignore any locally installed versions of the CLI and use the latest.
